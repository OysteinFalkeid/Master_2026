                <h2>Why I wanted to write a master with Punda</h2>
                <p>
                    I have always been fascinated by electrical equipment. 
                    And have dreamt of building robots ever sins i was a child and saw "Robots (2005)" the movie. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    As I started the masters in robotic at the 4. year I had no contacts and felt like stumbling in the dark. 
                    I had an exiting subject in robot navigation and got hooked on making the little turtlebot drive around. 
                    controlling the turtlebot with gamepads, keyboards or autonomously.
                    When Punda came to the master day on NMBU and presented that they wanted help doing teh same to their wheel I felt intrigued.
                    After careful consideration I concluded that the variation and hands onn task it wold be to make the Punda wheel wireless and autonomous was something for me.

                <!-- <p>
                    As a child I realized I needed a higher education to get to work with the tasks I enjoy.
                    One major problem however was getting thru the education system so I cold start on a master. 
                    I ultimately decided to try working as an electrician
