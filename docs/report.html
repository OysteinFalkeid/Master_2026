            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                Agriculture has always been hard work. We as humans have outsourced more and 
                more of the hardest tasks to others. Such as horses and tractors. 
                The punda wheel is the hard working parts of a tractor, compressed inside one wheel.
                But a wheel can not move by itself, no mater how fast the engine spins. To give the 
                punda wheel life I aim to create a differential drive robot, capable of handling tasks 
                suitable for a small tractor. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To accomplish this task i will:
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Establish wireless communication</li>
                <li>Create hardware interface in ROS capable of handling several wheels</li>
                <li>create a virtual clone </li>
                <li>explore different sensors and analyze the robots optimal setup.</li>
            </ul><br>

            <p>
                To accomplish these task We will look at a variety of solutions and their pros and cons.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                Wireless communication can be accomplished in a number of ways. 
                However the punda wheel I am using is equipped with an ESP32 WROOM.
                This limits the number of available protocols. What is the optimal solution for this application and why?
            </p><br>

            <p>
                A hardware interface is a software package in ROS that exposes the 
                functionality of the hardware to the ROS pipelines. 
                This means every wheel has its own separate program running.
                And can have a unique identifier.
                How dose this scale for robots with more than tow wheels?
            </p><br>

            <p>
                Gazebo is the simulation software i will be using. 
                By creating a URDF I can explore different sensors and bases. 
                What sensors dose the robot need and what is the best body shape?
                The body width affects the wheel placement and thus where the robot can be used.

            <h1>Communication diagram</h1>
            <p>Wireless communication is key as it enables more freedom. This diagram shows how the 3 main parts of the system comunicates</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Development machine: 
                    this computer is durable and can handle large amounts of heavy calculations. 
                    The machine will be used for SLAM, simulation, debugging and other diagnostic tasks.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Raspberry pi: 
                    This is a tiny computer (other small computers can be used). 
                    The raspberry pi runs ROS and handles the main part of the ROS program. 
                    The pi (Raspberry pi) can handle SLAM and autonomous driving.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    ESP32 WROOM32: 
                    This is a 32 bit microcontroller and can be programed using C++. 
                    The microcontroller has peripheral components capable of completing a large range of tasks. 
                    This gives a good basis for early development, as the controller has hardware for almost every task and some capabilities for brute forcing other tasks using the cpu.
